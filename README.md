# SurveyLab

Ive learned that most Republicans think that the news is lying to them. According to this survey 52 percent of republicans and 35 percent of democrats belive that the news lies and is controlled by big coorporations trying to pick and choose what information to give people to get them to think a certain way. I also learned that in august of 2020 when covid was at its biggest 93 percent of democrats always wore masks in buildings where as for republicans it was 80 percent. When looking at who struggled to pay for medical builds it doesnt varry at all by political stance, as I had expected.

When looking through that book I was able to find out how to make a bar graph. It is a clear and easy way to see and differentiate data and hae it remain easy to understand.
